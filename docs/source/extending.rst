Extending and contributing
==========================

``pybop`` welcomes and appreciates contribution and extension to the module. Rather than local modifications, we request that the modifications be submitted through a pull request, so that the module can be continuously improved.  

..

    ``pybop`` follows the `pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style. The quality of the code can be checked by `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ library by running ``pylint yourscript.py``. Rather than the style of code, what is more important is the documentation. We request that all improvements are documented in detail.
