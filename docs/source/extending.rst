Extending and contributing
==========================

**pybop** welcomes contribution and extension to the module. Rather than local modifications, we request that the modifications be submitted through a pull request. **pybop** follows the `pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style. The quality of the code can be checked by `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ library by running ``pylint yourscript.py``. Rather than the style of code, what is more important is the documentation. We request that all improvements are documented in detail.
