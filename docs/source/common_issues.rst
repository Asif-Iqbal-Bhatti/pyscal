Common issues
=============

*	**Installation of the package without administrator privileges**    
	
	In case of any problems with installation, we recommend that you install the package in a conda environment. Details on managing and creating environments can be found `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ .

*	**C++11 is not available**   
	
	``pyscal`` needs C++11 to install and run. In case you do not have c++11, it can be installed in a conda environment by following this `link <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/gcc>`_ . After installing gcc, once the conda environment is reactivated, the environment variables are set. The installation should proceed now without problems.

*	**cmake is not available**    
	
	cmake can be installed in a conda environment. Details on managing and creating environments can be found `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ . The cmake package can be installed from conda following `this <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/cmake>`_ link.
