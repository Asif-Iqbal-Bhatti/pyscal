Various parameters have found specific uses, such as $q_2$ and $q_6$ for identification of crystallinity, $q_6$ for identification of solidity, and $q_4$ and $q_6$ for distinction of crystal structures. The traditional method makes use of a cutoff radius which takes into account the neighbors of an atom. The cutoff can be chosen based on different methods available.  Once the cutoff is chosen and neighbors are calculated, the calculation of Steinhardt parameters are straightforward."
