"""
Even though super short on time, this module has to be reimagined a bit.
This stems from the fact that pybind11 objects are hard to pickle. So,
we will use alternative classes here - Atomc, and Systemc. These classes
will be used as container ones. Afterwards, we have to find a way to 
exchange information between the C++ classes and these python ones. 

Pickling pybind11 code is important. So is thinkiing about migrating to
Ã‡ython. This is a temporary solution. Steinhardt tools will evolve.

    --updated function--
    Reads in trajectory and creates Atoms which would be assigned to a class.
    These classes are then stored as a pickled array. New output is a pickled file.

    --old documentation--
    Read in a MD trajectory file and create an atom
    structure from it. For each timeslice, the return array has a slice, which in turn
    contains two sub-slices. The first one is the box dimensions and the second one is
    a list of all atoms in that particular time slices.

    The output data is .npy file. The array is of the dimension [[Box,[Atom1,Atom2..AtomN]],
    [Box,[Atom1,Atom2..AtomN]], .....(number of time slices)]. The output is in delayed
    format (using Dask) to avoid actual reading through of the input data. The x coordinate
    of Atom 0 at time step 1 can be accessed by-
    nsystems[0][1][0].x : The first index is time step, the second to show its atomm and 
    the third finally the index of atom. However this would be delayed object. The actual
    value can be accessed as required by nsystems[0][1][0].x.compute()   

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile : string
        name of the input trajectory file

    natoms : array like
        the number of atoms in each time slice. If the number of atoms in each slice
        is same, a single integer value can be provided. Otherwise a list of entries
        equal to the number of time slices has to be provided.

    **kwargs : 
        delayed (bool) : False, True if a dask delayed system is to be saved. 
        save_file (bool) : True, True if an outfile is to be saved, False otherwise
            save_file is now deprecated and is on by default.
        return_array (bool) : False, True if array is to be returned, False otherwise
            return_array is now deprecated and is off by default
        nslices (int) : 1, number of time slices in the trajectory
        format (string) : lammps, the format of the trajectory file
        outfile (string) : name of the output file

    Returns

    nsystems : array like
